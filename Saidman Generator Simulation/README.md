### Saidman Generator Simulation for kidney excahnges 
We utilized some parts of the code written for [this project](https://github.com/JohnDickerson/KidneyExchange) and modified it according to our simulation environment. We updated the used version of Saidman simulator to generate kidney exchange data that has a distribution mimics the UNOS pool as of April 15, 2013 and is computed based on the Cumulative Match Report performed by the data analysis group in [this study](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2482596).

#### System requirements 
32-bit/64-bit Windows/Linux machine with (JDK and JRE that supports  `junit-*.*.jar ` and  `jgrapht-*.*.jar `).
In this version, we used  `junit-4.7.jar ` and  `jgrapht-0.8.2.jar `.
